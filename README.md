glassfish-maven-plugin
======================

Glassfish administration plugin for Maven. 

This is a fork of https://java.net/projects/maven-glassfish-plugin/sources/svn/show/trunk.
I decided to copy the project as the original hasn't been changed for a while and there are
are no active users on the project. Most functionality worked but the options for GF v3 are
changed slightly and some options are also missing (e.g. for create Java Mail Sessions).
